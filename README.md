# Generic loggers for graph_process_manager_core

4 types of loggers to log processes implemented/tooled with graph_process_manager_core :
- a GraphViz logger to produce graphical representations of the processes
- a nodesPrint logger to print in files intermediate objects build during the process
- a stepsTrace logger to print in files traces i.e. sequences of steps taken during the process
- a NFAIT logger to build a Non Deterministic Finite Automaton (with Immediate Transitions)

Trivial example uses are given in the test module. We shortly describe them in the following.

## Fibonacci sequence

In this example, we explore the Fibonacci sequence.
A maximum depth is set to 10 for this example.

Applying a simple GraphViz logger to this example process gives the following representation:

The following Automata can be build from this exploration :

A nodesPrint logger is used here to print the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence in text files
and a stepsTrace logger is used to print the sequence of 'next' steps 
(here it is a trivial application but for other processes there may be various kinds of steps etc.).

Below is represented the files generated by the two loggers for the example toy process:

## Binary Tree

In this example we explore words built incrementally from 'O' by appending letters 'A' and 'B' to the right.
For the exploration we set a maximum depth of 4 and a maximum number of nodes (words) of 8.

Depending on the heuristic we use for the exploration, we do not reach the same set of words.

Using a BFS (Breadth First Search) we get the following:

Using a DFS (Depth First Search) we get the following:

Using a HCS (High Coverage Search, which favors branches with the least common prefixes) we get the following:

Explorations can be further specialized using more detailed filters and priorities for the selection of the next steps to take.
Randomization of the next steps to take is also possible.
